A real-time computer vision system that detects human faces from live video and estimates **Age**, **Gender**, and **Emotion** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  
All processing is performed **locally**, ensuring low latency and privacy preservation.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how deep learning–based **face analytics** can be applied in real-time scenarios.  
Using a webcam feed, the system detects faces and performs **multi-task inference** to extract meaningful facial attributes.

The focus of this project is on:
- Real-time performance
- CPU-based inference
- Practical deep learning pipeline design

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Task Learning**  
  Simultaneous prediction of age, gender, and emotion from a single face image.

- **Real-Time Inference**  
  Optimized for real-time execution on CPU.

- **Privacy-First Design**  
  All computations are performed locally; no cloud processing involved.

- **Modular Pipeline**  
  Independent stages for face detection and attribute prediction.

## 📊 Sample Output

Example of real-time emotion probability analysis generated by the system:

![Emotion Analysis Chart](Figure_1.png)

The chart visualizes confidence scores for different emotional states detected from a live video frame.
